description: At a time like this when charitable acts performed by strangers are saving the day for many, I am penning down my thoughts on charity, and what it means to encourage a culture of giving.

title: Is it still charity if you brag about it?

Well yes, it most certainly is. Does bragging about your philanthropic initiative in social circles reduce the philanthropic-ness of your actions? Not really. Questions that arise include - but doesn’t that mean you’re offering money to buy social validation? you’re using charity as a pawn for your personal advancement? Well, if Charity was a person, she would tell you it’s the thought that counts. (much like all women, even she had to lower her expectations)

#1 In a big bad world full of people who use everything from blackmail to force, from sharpened facial features to bureaucratic power to seek validation, your using charity is quite acceptable.

#2 Charity has never been, and will never be about the potential ‘Good Samaritan’ in question, it’s about the beneficiary. Ask yourself - does bragging about charitable work reduce the benefits that ultimately flow down to the beneficiary? Not really.

There’s a lot of dinner table talk about students who undertake ‘social service for the resumé’ and ‘social service for LinkedIn,’ not for the ‘greater good.’ Calling out these students for wanting something more out of their socially productive work other than the happiness that comes with giving is counterintuitive because as a society that promotes a culture of giving, we're winning even if one absolutely apathetic selfish student opts for social service only for potential personal benefits.

If your child gives away her 20 dollars of pocket money to a classmate who couldn’t afford lunch that day, and comes back home to tell you about it, expecting you to be a proud mother and probably even half-expecting you to buy her a 10-dollar ice-cream as a reward for her selflessness, I’m guessing it’s best to buy that ice-cream. You perpetuate a narrative that encourages selflessness, and you introduce her to a culture of giving. She could’ve bought two ice-creams with her 20-dollars of pocket money but the yearning for your approval made her feed a hungry child and eat only one ice-cream instead. Here's hoping you won’t use that instance to teach her that if her actions were truly selfless, she wouldn’t want anything in return.

Let’s identify which cohort of people is really working entirely selflessly for the greater good. Someone who feeds the poor and homeless at night without telling anyone about it? Someone who donates anonymously to Feeding India without claiming tax deductions on the donations? How different is the impact created by someone who donates the same amount, helps to feed the same number of hungry mouths, but claims tax deductions on her donations?

Does anyone do anything good entirely selflessly expecting nothing in return?
In this regard, let’s also address the idea of self-validation. What if the seemingly-selfless anonymous donor is donating to Feeding India to make herself feel better about her ridiculously-comfortable privileged life whereas deep inside she doesn’t actually care about feeding the hungry? She makes the donation without following up with the organization or bothering to find out if her funds were actually used for the intended purpose of feeding the hungry. Jury’s still out there trying to decide if she could qualify as selfless.

#3 Truth is - there never really is a way of understanding the true intention of the donor, and it doesn’t really make a difference to Feeding India or the world. They’d be happy to use your funds for a good cause.

At this point, it must seem like the rich can buy more social validation, more happiness and more clout by doing charity because they obviously have more to give.

#4 Charity is a proportionate function of how much you possess and what percentage of it you're willing to spare, and that’s a proportion only you can truly estimate because only you can appropriately conduct a cost-benefit analysis of your resources.

That being said – it’s still ridiculous to bash celebrities who organize fundraisers for good causes, arguing that ‘they already have enough money to reach the target amount, they can just donate all 10 million dollars themselves.’ It’s true that 10 million out of say 40 million still leaves a lot of bank balance, but it’s not fair to entirely absolve the middle class of contributing to causes, both monetarily and via services, because it can be said for a lot of us that we have a little bit more than we really truly need.

Besides, what about the social capital that accrues to a cause when famous people tweet about it in their fundraisers as compared to passively donating the amount they want to? What about the people who donate because they’re so hypnotized by Virat Kohli that they’re willing to get behind a cause just because Virat’s Instagram is behind it? As a society, we could definitely tap that potential. Social capital can be the win-it-all bet of a cause and we saw that with the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. At a time when virality and TikTok trends speak to people more than the news, it makes sense to use social media to make charity trendy. Let’s make charity viral.
