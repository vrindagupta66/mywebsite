title: HOW TO MAKE A BAD VIBE A GOOD VIBE
---
Most of us are familiar with the idea of bad vibes but we don’t know how to avoid these bad vibes. I am a very helplessly transparent person and every time something in my vicinity gives me bad vibes, my expressions and body language make my disdain very evident. It’s times like these that make it imperative for me to ensure that I handle vibes in a better manner. Here is a little bit of what I’ve learnt while trying to be a pleasant human to be around. A bad vibe could be attached to an:
- Object
- Time
- Place
- Situation
- Human

Although undoubtedly human acrimony is the worst. The cause for this is the power of human connection. It surpasses connections with objects and particular times, places and situations. The fulfilment and warmth that a human connection can provide is much more than anything an object or place could provide in times of need. And since the good vibe of a human connection is more extreme, the bad vibe can also prove to be the worst. Probably why famous classics speak so often about archenemies falling in love, and lovers becoming archenemies. But before getting into how we can avoid human acrimony, let’s understand all the others.

To explain this better I’m going to be using examples.

1) I have object oppugnancy for pineapple pastries. In short, they radiate bad vibes to me. Pineapple pastry was the most controversial food item that I ate before I was diagnosed with food poisoning and typhoid. I was nine years old then. My family admitted me to the quarantine ward at the best local hospital where I received an unlimited series of painful injections for ten infinitely long days. I would loudly curse that pineapple pastry every night before falling asleep, even though no one heard my screams, thanks to the efficiency of the quarantine measures.

2) The time I resent the most is the depressing winter evening, around the time of sunset. When the cold wind is starting to blow as a result of cool heavy air replacing the previously light warmed up air, piercing through my face and chilling my nose. It’s in times like these when I start to unnecessarily introspect and question everything amidst the silence that is created due to the absence of fans and air conditioner background noise.

3) A place that emits bad vibes is this empty room beside my classroom. Whenever things were bothering me and I was sad, I used that room to sit and think to myself to make myself feel more light headed. Until today each time I visit that room, it reminds me of the previous bad days. It makes me think of the reasons that pushed me to my edge and drove me to that place again and again. But at the same time despite all of this, I continue to visit it once in a while because each visit gives me a feeling of impending recovery and a vibe of positive transformation. I seriously discourage practices like these though.

4) Here’s a situation radiating bad vibes that should provide some comic relief. I love listening to music on my iPod and watching music videos on TV. Learning up song lyrics and singing along with the video while also mimicking the artists and dancers is my favourite hobby. And undoubtedly I look extremely funny going through this entire process of carefully watching and rewatching the video, repeating the lyrics and then trying to copy the artists. Despite being fully aware of how hilarious I look while doing this, I hate it when insensitive onlookers join me in the process and decide to have a good laugh at my expense. This becomes my situational bad vibe.

5) For gossip loving readers that were expecting some examples of a human bad vibe should get ready for some bloopers because I don’t think its necessary to name innocent people who are to blame for nothing. This is where it becomes important to understand that a bad vibe is your problem and yours alone. There is nothing that the object of the vibe can do about the vibe because you, the subject, are helplessly and indirectly drawing the negativity from him/her. Here are a few things I do when the bad vibe starts to hit me.

If your surroundings allow it, plug in your earphones and put on your best feel good song. At first it’ll be a forced move because when your mood is off, party music just doesn’t gel well. But doing this for a while can prove to be very helpful and distracting. Soon the music will engage you and you’ll realise how important it is to look at the innumerable fun aspects of life instead of constantly harping about the sad little things.
If you’re physically around the person that’s emitting these bad vibes, try to find that one thing in your vicinity that has a good memory attached to it and ponder over every detail of that memory. For example if I see that person, that radiates bad vibes to me sitting in a cafe, I concentrate on the glass of soda lime next to him/her and ponder over how much fun I had the last time I bunked class to go out with my college friends to drink soda lime. I think about how hot it was and how heavenly that chilled soda lime felt in my mouth.
If you’re dealing with the bad vibes of a person you have fallen out with due to some kind of differences, try to concentrate on the good things that person did for you at a point of time. Acknowledge all the talents and impressive habits of that individual. This activity makes you realise that no matter how bad a person may seem, everyone has a good bone in their body that is worth appreciating and learning from.
