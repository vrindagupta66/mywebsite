title: A FAMILIARITY IN DISAPPROVAL
---
Some processes haven’t changed in their house since time immemorial. Some things haven’t been replaced with their widely available modern versions, since they were bought ten years ago.

The idea that the house would be furnished only with the most durable and long-lasting products was conceived when the house was brought to life by Jai and Tara, its proud co-owners. A few months after their wedding when it became obvious that the couple wanted to spend an eternity together, Jai and Tara realized that they wanted their home to reflect the same indispensable sense of permanence.

The couple believed that growing old with one’s belongings is a charm and a privilege. In a way, they felt that each belonging had its own story to tell. The couple was certain that each belonging would absorb the family’s happy memories and act as a witness of their growing love over the years. On gloomy days, each belonging would reflect back all of the love and positivity selflessly in the form of warmth and familiarity. Tara was certain that the house would feel like a tight hug on days when Jai was away for work.

Jai and Tara used their decade of togetherness to carefully curate each item and vibe of the house. In short, none of the ancient, upholstered chairs, or the beautifully color-coordinated coffee mugs are a coincidence. This lifestyle worked for the couple brilliantly because it’s undoubtedly economical, peaceful and sustainable. The world is writing about it in magazines now, but the skies know that Jai and Tara had successfully hopped onto this bandwagon a decade ago.

All the flowerpots in the garden, carpets in the living room, toothbrush stands in the bathroom, coffee mugs in the kitchen, are still the same, as they were ten years ago. Well, if not all, at least the ones that weren’t stolen or lost. The house is prim and proper and well-polished at all times. It has a rustic vibe to it which has been maintained with a lot of effort over the years, quite ironically.

Jai and Tara were insufferable perfectionists in matters related to the house right from the day its first brick was laid down. These tendencies often led them to have misunderstandings and fights, especially on hectic workdays that coincided with cleaning days. However, at night when the couple retired to the comfort of their canopy bed, they felt nothing but awe for the perfection they had created together.

In this moment, Jai is peeking into the vintage grey kitchen cabinet that stores all the coffee mugs. He effortlessly picks out a plain black ceramic mug. There is another identical black mug in the cabinet, which is Tara’s, but Jai has no trouble distinguishing between the mugs because years of following the same morning coffee routine does that to you.

Jai tilts the mug a little and pours steaming coffee into it with the utmost care to avoid spilling the liquid on the outside of the mug. Tara had introduced Jai to the idea of discipline at coffee on their very first coffee date when it had dawned upon her that Jai was a barbarian.

Jai walks slowly to the porch with his cup of coffee and places it on the coffee table, purposely avoiding the coaster. He noisily drags out his rocking chair from the living room instead of using the patio chair. He takes the liberty to add an extra spoon of sugar to his coffee. Jai’s actions suggest a rebellious state of mind. If Tara saw this, she would instantly disapprove. 

Jai briefly glances at his coffee mug and realizes that it’s kept right at the edge of the table. A moment later, the mug is endangered by a gush of wind. As the mug starts to shake nervously, Jai leaps out of his chair to reach for it. If Tara were here to witness his negligence, she would instantly disapprove.

In that moment, Jai realizes that Tara isn’t here to witness him anymore. She hasn’t been here for years. He imagines her voice of disapproval checking his bad habits, but his yearning ears don’t hear a thing. Perhaps, she is in a better place now.

Jai lets the mug fall to the ground and shatter into a million pieces. He feels a sense of relief hidden beneath hordes of guilt. The curse of the identical coffee mugs has been broken. The house doesn’t feel like a tight hug. He hates his canopy bed. Tara would disapprove of his tears.
